<h2>Challenge 5: Accessability Statement</h2>
<p>Even though I didn't do challenge 2 of the chessboard, I imagine this would be a really hard one
  for a screenreader to transcribe. The reader would likely say "square/block 1, white, square/block 2, black..."
  for all 64 blocks, which would take a lot of time and be frustrating for the user to sit through. To address
  this and other accesability concerns, I would take the time to add in a name that makes sense for all labels
  that a screenreader may use, and think critically about how I create things like tables or images and find the best
  way to display things. For example, the chess table could have been an image with a label of a chessboard instead of a
  table with filled in squares. Further, I would think about accessability in terms of color blindness once I start using
  colors besides black and white.
