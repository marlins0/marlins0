    <h1>Assignment 6</h1>
    <p>This is assignment 6 for web! We're working with CSS for the first time.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/">CSS stands for Caascading Style Sheets</a> and is a way to style a page so it doesn't look so blah.</p>
    <p>There are a few areas on this page where CSS is helping us</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The color of the body text</li>
      <li>The weight of the body text</li>
      <li>The color of the links text</li>
      <li>The color and size of the heading</li>
      <li>The color of the horizontal rule (line)</li>
      <li>The style of this very list</li>
    </ol>

    <button type="button" name="Click me!">Click me! Who knows what happens?</button>
  </body>
