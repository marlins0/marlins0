        <h3>Interviewing the Cast and Crew of The Batman</h3>
        <p>My most recent project has been interviewing the cast and crew of The Batman and writing an article
        reviewing the movie. To read all about it (spoiler warning) go <a href="https://www.hercampus.com/school/
        cu-boulder/the-batman-rob-pattinson-reinvents-eyeliner/">here!</a> This was a super fun project to work on,
        not just because I got to interact with so many cool people, but I saw the movie before it was released to the
        general public. I really loved working on this, and it pushed me out of my normal beat of fashion, food and culture.
        Writing about a specific piece of media and diving into how I felt about it and what I liked was super fun.</p>

          <h3>Volunteering</h3>
        <p>I set up volunteering with a domestic violence shelter with Her Campus CU Boulder.
        We volunteer with them about once a month and organize their donations, assist with childcare and
        host resume workshops. This is a rewarding project to work on, since we see the facility stay more and more organized
        each time we go, so it really feels like we're making a difference. The faculty at the shelter is so grateful for the work
        that we do. </p>

          <h3>Writing Portfolio</h3>
          <p>This is my full writing portfolio, with all of my published work through <a href="https://www.hercampus.com/author/marita-blake/">Her Campus CU Boulder.</a>
          I have been a part of HCCU for a year and a half now and write an average of 5 articles a month. HCCU has been a really amazing
          place for me to meet new friends, have a writing outlet and to build my resume. HCCU has led me to my first internship, which is,
          of course, always the hardest one to get. I have learned about my own leadership style, had lots of practice with time management and
          gotten published in the process. </p>
