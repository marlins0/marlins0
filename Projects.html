        <p>My most recent project has been interviewing the cast and crew of The Batman and writing an article
        reviewing the movie. To read all about it (spoiler warning) go <a href="https://www.hercampus.com/school/

        <p>I also set up a lot of volunteering with a domestic violence shelter with Her Campus CU Boulder.
        We volunteer with them about once a month and organize their donations, assist with childcare and
        host resume workshops.</p>

          <p>This is my full writing portfolio, with all of my published work through Her Campus CU Boulder.
          I have been a part of HCCU for a year and a half now and write an average of 5 articles a month.</p>
