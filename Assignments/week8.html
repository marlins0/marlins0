      <h1>Assignment 8 -- Responsive Site Design</h1>
      <p>This week we worked with responsive site design, which means that the webpage
      will change when it moves to different sized screens to be most compatable with each
      one. People used to make entirelty different sites for phones and laptops, which
      proved difficult because there's many different screen sizes. </p>

      <p>Hi, everyone! My name is Marita Blake and I am a Supply Chain Management and Marketing major with
        a minor in Creative Technology and Design. I use she/her pronouns and I'm excited to learn about
        website design in this class! My goal for this course are to actually understand what I am doing,
        as I never understood anything in my last coding class.</p>
