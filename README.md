### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hi, my name is Marita Blake! I am an junior at CU Boulder majoring in business
administration with emphases in supply chain and marketing and a minor in
creative technology and design (which is why I am taking this class!). I am a
part of Her Campus CU Boulder, which is an online magazine for collegiate women.

I have a pet lizard named Walter and I am from York, Pennsylvania.
