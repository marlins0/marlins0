<title>Capacollo Ham</title>

        <h1>Capacollo Ham</h1>
        <hr>
      <p>Capocollo[1] (Italian pronunciation: [kapoˈkɔllo])[2] or coppa ([ˈkɔppa])[3] is a traditional Italian and Corsican
        pork cold cut (salume) made from the dry-cured muscle running from the neck to the fourth or fifth rib of the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pork">Pork</a></strong>
        shoulder or neck. It is a whole-muscle salume, dry cured, and typically sliced very thin. It is similar to the more
        widely known cured ham or prosciutto, because they are both pork-derived cold-cuts used in similar dishes. It is not
        brined as ham typically is.</p>

        <h2 id="Terminology">Terminology</h2>
        <p>This cut is typically called capocollo or coppa in much of <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy">Italy</a></strong>. This name is a compound of the words capo ("head")
          and collo ("neck"). Regional terms include capicollo (Campania and Calabria) and capicollu (Corsica). Outside of Italy,
          terms include bondiola or bondiola curada in Argentina and Uruguay, and capicola or capicolla in North America.[4] The
          pronunciation "gabagool" has been used by Italian Americans in the New York City area and elsewhere in the Northeast,
          based on the pronunciation of "capcuoll" in working-class dialects of 19th- and early 20th-century Neapolitan.[5] It
          was notably used in the television series <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sopranos">The Sopranos</a></strong>
          and its use has become a well-known stereotype.[6][7][8]</p>

        <p>In its production, capocollo is first lightly seasoned often with red and sometimes white <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wine">wine</a></strong>, garlic, and a variety
          of herbs and spices that differs depending on region. The meat is then salted (and was traditionally massaged) and
          stuffed into a natural casing, and hung for up to six months to cure. Sometimes the exterior is rubbed with hot paprika
          before being hung and cured. Capocollo is essentially the pork counterpart of the air-dried, cured beef bresaola. It is
          widely available wherever significant Italian communities occur, due to commercially produced varieties. The slow-roasted
          Piedmontese version is called coppa cotta. Capocollo is esteemed for its delicate flavor and tender, fatty texture, and is
          often more expensive than most other salumi. In many countries, it is often sold as a gourmet food item. It is usually
          sliced thin for use in  <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antipasto">antipasto</a></strong> or sandwiches such as muffulettas, Italian grinders and subs, and panini, as well as some
          traditional Italian pizza.</p>

        <p>Two particular varieties, Coppa Piacentina and Capocollo di Calabria, have Protected Designation of Origin status under the
          Common Agricultural Policy of  <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe">European</a></strong> Union law, which ensures that only products genuinely originating in those regions are
          allowed in commerce as such.[9][10] Five additional Italian regions produce capocollo, and are not covered under European law,
          but are designated as "Prodotto agroalimentare tradizionale" by the Italian Ministry of Agricultural, Food, and Forestry Policies:
          Slices of Capocollo di Martina Franca served with figs, Capocollo della Basilicata;[11], Capocollo del Lazio;[12], Capocollo di
          Martina Franca[13] is a traditional capocollo of Apulia. It is smoked with laurel leaves,  <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thyme">thyme</a></strong>, almonds, Mediterranean herbs and
          pieces of bark of Macedonian Oak (called fragno in Italian), a tree typical of Southeastern Italy, the Balkans and Western Turkey.
          Usually it is served with figs, Capocollo tipico senese or finocchiata, from Tuscany;[14], Capocollo dell'Umbria;[15], Outside
          Europe, capocollo was introduced to Argentina by Italian immigrants, under the names bondiola or bondiola curada.</p>
