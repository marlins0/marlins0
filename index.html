<h1>Hello!</h1>
<p>Hi everyone! My name is Marita and I am a Junior at CU Boulder. I am an operations management and marketing
major with a minor in creative technology and design. I am originally from Pennsylvania, and now
live in Boulder for school. I am interested in fashion, design, food and culture. I write for a club
on campus called <a href="https://www.hercampus.com/author/marita-blake/">Her Campus CU Boulder</a> and
recently interviewed Rob Pattinson and Zoe Kravitz about the new Batman movie for it!</p>
<p>I have a pet bearded dragon named Walter who I spend lots of time with. I also spend my days binging
bad TV, watching The Devil Wears Prada and trying on endless outfits to get just the right one.
</p>
<p>My goals for the future are to get a job in New York or Philly in sustainable fashion supply chain
analytics. Eventually, I'd like to have my own fashion brand that has similar ethics to brands like
The North Face or Patagonia, but high fashion instead of outdoorsy wear.</p>
