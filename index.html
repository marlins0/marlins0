        <p>Hi, everyone! My name is <strong>Marita Blake</strong> and I am a Supply Chain management</p>
        <p>and marketing major with a minor in Creative Technology and Design. </p>
        <p>I use she/her pronouns and I'm excited to learn about website design in this class!</p>
        <p>My goal for this course are to actually understand what I am doing, as I never </p>
        <p>understood anything in my last coding class. </p>
